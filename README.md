## 🧠 What is Digit Span Training?

Digit span is a cognitive test that measures working memory capacity. This advanced version uses a unique filtering rule that makes the exercise more challenging and engaging:

- **Always remember the first number**
- **Remember subsequent numbers only if they're greater than the previous number**

This filtering rule trains your brain to selectively process information while maintaining multiple numbers in working memory.

## 🎯 Game Features

### 🏆 Multiple Difficulty Levels
- **Easy**: 4-6 target numbers to remember
- **Medium**: 7-8 target numbers to remember  
- **Hard**: 9-10 target numbers to remember

### 🔥 All-in-One Challenge Mode
Progress through all difficulty levels in a single session for the ultimate challenge!

### ⚙️ Customizable Settings
- Adjustable display time per digit (0.25s - 3.0s)
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- Keyboard support for number input

### 📊 Smart Feedback
- Visual feedback showing correct vs incorrect answers
- Complete sequence breakdown after each round
- Progressive difficulty increase within each level

## 🚀 How to Play

1. **Choose your settings**: Select difficulty level and display time
2. **Watch the sequence**: Numbers will appear one by one
3. **Apply the rule**: Remember the first number and any number greater than the previous
4. **Enter your answer**: Use the on-screen numpad or keyboard
5. **Get feedback**: See how you did and learn from mistakes
6. **Progress**: Complete rounds to advance to longer sequences

### Example
Sequence shown: `3 → 7 → 2 → 8 → 5 → 9`

Numbers to remember:
- `3` (first number - always remember)
- `7` (greater than 3 - remember)
- `2` (less than 7 - ignore)
- `8` (greater than 7 - remember)
- `5` (less than 8 - ignore)
- `9` (greater than 8 - remember)

**Correct answer**: `3789`

## 🧪 Benefits of Digit Span Training

Regular practice can help improve:
- **Working memory capacity**
- **Attention and focus**
- **Cognitive flexibility**
- **Information processing speed**
- **Mental arithmetic skills**

## 🔬 The Science

This game is based on cognitive psychology research into working memory and attention. The filtering rule adds an executive function component, requiring you to:

1. **Store information** (working memory)
2. **Apply rules** (executive control)
3. **Selectively attend** (attention)
4. **Maintain sequences** (memory span)

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- **Zero dependencies** - runs in any modern web browser
- **Vanilla JavaScript** - no frameworks required
- **Responsive CSS** - adapts to any screen size
- **Self-contained** - single HTML file with embedded CSS and JS
